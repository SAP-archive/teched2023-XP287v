# Getting started

## Goal ðŸŽ¯

In this exercise, you will create your two required trial accounts: one for SAP Landscape Management Cloud and one for the SAP Business Technology Platform

## Create your 30-day trial of SAP Landscape Management Cloud

After completing these steps you will have a trial account of SAP Landscape Management Cloud ready to be explored and to be used in this jump-start session.

1. Open [https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/landscape-management.html](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/landscape-management.html)
2. Login with your SAP Account at the right of the page.
3. After logging-in, select `Try SAP Landscape Management Cloud`.
4. On the following page, select `Start your 30-day free trial`.
5. Once you see the "Congratulations" message, select `Click here to start your trial!`

This will create your trial tenant of SAP Landscape Management Cloud and afterwards open the onboarding wizard for the solution. As SAP Landscape Management Cloud is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution to manage SAP systems in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environments, you need to start by onboarding the IaaS account with certain permissions, policies, and credentials. In the trial environment, users can provide any details and no real IaaS account is required. If you plan on using SAP Landscape Management Cloud for your system landscape, the [Onboarding guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_LANDSCAPE_MANAGEMENT_CLOUD/e89209f1566d4a7aaf0631e1a1755653/fea7f79059bd42e5b6e76bcd9a07ba51.html?locale=en-US) describes all necessary steps and prerequisites.

For now, continue by selecting `Start Trial`. This will open a small survey to better understand your role in the organization. At its end, you can watch a solution overview video or skip it as we will discover the solution as part of the exercises. 

The trial tenant will open with a Guided Tour which you can skip. This will be part of exercise 1.
